# Arduino Projects
A repository of Arduino Sketches(program) I wrote while learning micro-controller programming

## Technologies
* Arduino IDE
* Arduino Uno micro-controller

## Runing Sketches(Program)

1. Download or clone repository.

2. Open sketch(program) you want to run in Arduino IDE.

3. Configure Arduino micro-controller with required things like LED, resistors etc.

4. Connect Arduino Uno micro-controller. 

5. Connect the Arduino UNO micro-controller to Arduino IDE:
     ```
        In the Arduino IDE:
        Tools > Board > Arduino Uno
        If Arduino is connected, you will see "Board: Arduino Uno"
     ```
     
6. Connect port for the Arduino IDE to communicate with the Arduino UNO micro-controller
     ```
        In the Arduino IDE:
        Tools > Port > Select port (eg. COM1 or COM3)
        If the port is connected, you will see the port is connected to COM. Eg. "Port: COM3(Arduino Uno)"
     ```
     
6. Compile and Run sketch(program)
     ```
        In the Arduino IDE:
        Sketch > Upload 
        
     ```
